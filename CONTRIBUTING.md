# How to contribute

Hi! Great that you want to contribute to Azure Functions University! 😃

We're currently focussed on creating beginner content for Azure Functions written in C#.

## Step 1 - GitHub Issues

Please check if there's an [existing issue](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university/issues) which matches your idea. Perhaps you can collaborate with someone on this.

If you have  new idea, please [create a new __Content Request__ issue](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university/issues/new?assignees=&labels=content&template=content_request.md&title=Content+Request%3A+%3CTITLE%3E) first where you can describe the topic.

## Step 2 - Process

If you are contributing to create a lesson, please take into account the length and the tone of the existing lessons. We want to have a uniform experience across all of our lessons.

Once we've discussed the Content Request issue and agree to include the lesson you can submit a PR with the lesson and the source code. It will probably take a few iterations to get everything right, don't feel discouraged by this process ♥.

### Lesson Structure

Please keep in mind the following when creating a lesson:

- Give the lesson a short but descriptive title.
- Describe the goal of the lesson.
- Break up the lesson in small exercises.
- Each exercise has a clear sub goal and steps how to achieve that sub goal.
- Use code samples and plenty of 📝, 🔎 and ❔ call-outs.
- Use gender-neutral language and avoid words such as 'easy' or 'simple'.
- Add a new project to the `src` folder with a completely working and running example.
