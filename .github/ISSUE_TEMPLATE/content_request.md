### Process

If you are contributing to create a lesson, please take into account the length and the tone of the existing lessons. We want to have a uniform experience across all of our lessons.

Submit this issue first so we can discuss it before submitting a PR.

### Lesson structure

Please keep in mind the following structure of the lessons:

- Describe the goal of the lesson.
- Break up the lesson in small exercises.
- Each exercise has a clear sub goal and steps how to achieve that sub goal.
- Use code samples and plenty of 📝, 🔎 and ❔ call-outs.
- Add a new project to the `src` folder with a completely worked out example.
